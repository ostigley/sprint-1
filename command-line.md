Hey Mum,
the command line is tool on your computer, that can be used to carry out certain tasks.  These tasks written instructions, that you can type in to the command line.  So, you command it to do stuff for you.   'Why don't you just click around like normal?', I hear you ask.  Well, you can do that too, but sometimes, if you really know what you are doing, you can be much faster by using the command line.  Also, some of the more complicated tasks are more efficiently carried out using the command line, instead of using the mouse. 

It's just like how Harry Potter can speak parcel tongue, which lets him speak to snakes.  Once you learn parcel tongue, you can get snakes to do things for you. 

Here are 10 terminal (command line / parcel tongue) commands you can try:
ls 
(this lists all the files in the directory you are currently in)
pwd 
(this prints out in the command line, where you are in the file system, or your 'current working directory')
cd
(this changes the directory (or folder) you are in.  for example: cd workspace/users witll take you to that directory)
cp
(copy!  You can copy files like this: cp oliver.txt oliver2.txt)
mv
(moves stuff! you can use it to move files like this: mv oliver.text workspace/users... it can also be used to rename files)
rm
(deletes things: rm oliver.txt)
mkdir
(makes new directories, or folders: mkdir Oliver/)
touch
(makes new files: touch  oliver.txt)
open
(opens the file you want: open olive.txt)
cat
(displays the contents of the file in the command line: cat oliver.txt)



See you later
Love
Olly.
